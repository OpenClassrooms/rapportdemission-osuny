        <p>Every year, we revisit our mission statement: Make Education Accessible. Not to change it, but to consider how to best implement it. We crafted this mission to guide us, yet annually, we must reconsider the objectives that will actualize this statement. This marks our fifth mission report, summarizing our endeavors to breathe life into the mission alongside a set of objectives defined by our mission committee.<br></p>

        <p>Upon our transition to a mission-driven company in 2018, our mission committee outlined operational objectives aimed at addressing five categories of students who face specific barriers to accessing education: <br></p>

        <p>Over the following four years, our mission reports described the progress we made in growing the share of those underserved populations among our students. This endeavor involved various initiatives such as developing partnerships, securing dedicated fundings streams, targeted marketing and more. In last year’s report, we found out that 79 % of our students belonged to at least one of those underserved groups. This indicated that our efforts had effectively contributed to facilitating access to education for these students. </p><p>With that key learning in mind, the mission committee reconsidered what it means to make education truly accessible. They found that despite overcoming the specific barriers to education, our underserved students still faced obstacles to employment. Consequently, the committee decided to refresh its approach with a deeper focus on 2 categories and evolving our impact measurement <br></p>
