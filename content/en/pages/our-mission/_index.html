        <p>Every year, we revisit our mission statement: Make Education Accessible. Not to change it, but to consider how to best implement it. We crafted this mission to guide us, yet annually, we must reconsider the objectives that will actualize this statement. This marks our fifth mission report, summarizing our endeavors to breathe life into the mission alongside a set of objectives defined by our mission committee.<br></p>

      A new perspective on  our objectives

        <p>Upon our transition to a mission-driven company in 2018, our mission committee outlined operational objectives aimed at addressing five categories of students who face specific barriers to accessing education: <br></p>

        <p>→ unemployed individuals </p><p>→ individuals with low to no qualifications </p><p>→ residents of disadvantaged areas </p><p>→ refugees </p><p>→ individual with disabilities<br></p>

        <p>Over the following four years, our mission reports described the progress we made in growing the share of those underserved populations among our students. This endeavor involved various initiatives such as developing partnerships, securing dedicated fundings streams, targeted marketing and more. In last year’s report, we found out that 79% of our students belonged to at least one of those underserved groups. This indicated that our efforts had effectively contributed to facilitating access to education for these students. </p><p>With that key learning in mind, the mission committee reconsidered what it means to make education truly accessible. They found that despite overcoming the specific barriers to education, our underserved students still faced obstacles to employment. Consequently, the committee decided to refresh its approach with a deeper focus on 2 categories and evolving our impact measurement <br></p>

        <p><b>→ Quantitatively</b><br>To reach and maintain a minimum proportion of 70% of our students belonging to one of these categories. </p><p><b>→ Qualitatively</b><br>to launch a communication campaign to deconstruct stereotypes about career changes to attract more atypical profiles to the tech industry; to provide each student with personalized training and funding options to improve accessibility.</p><p>Both of these goals were achieved. Quantitatively, in 2023, 75% of our students belonged to at least one of these priority categories. Qualitatively, a major communication campaign was deployed on social media with four video portraits of our students on the theme of overcoming mental barriers related to disability, age, education level, and gender stereotypes. Finally, the redesign of our admission funnel allowed us to create a personalized process to recommend training and funding options to candidates.<br></p>

        <p>Women only account for 26% of employees in tech companies, and that number drops to 16% when considering only technical roles.

      2. Evolving our impact assessment: This methodology will focus less on the number of people we reach (how many underserved students do we serve, and how much growth we generated), but rather on the depth of the impact we have on each individual. In other words, our goal will be to understand how OpenClassrooms is able to positively impact the life of every student by making education accessible to them.

        <p>We aim to develop a calculation formula that will enable us to quantify, in monetary terms or other means, the changes experienced by a student before and after studying with us. Additionally, we intend to measure the broader economic and financial impact across various stakeholders: employers, state and government services, and the wider community.<br></p>

        <p>As a result of this new approach, this report is work in progress. We’re still reporting against the five underserved categories we have been using in the past, but we have added our two new areas of focus. Additionally, we are experimenting for the first time with a new Impact calculation model that will be updated in 2025 as we learn more in the future.<br></p>

        <p>The acknowledged advantages of apprenticeship for both parties, coupled with the chance to connect students with employers on our platform, prompted a change in our priorities. We are now dedicated to making education accessible by effectively pairing apprenticeship candidates with employers. </p><p>This is why a considerable amount of effort has been invested in building the OpenClassrooms talent marketplace (for employers) and the job board (for apprenticeship candidates).<br></p>

        <p>This strategy is also applicable to employers who are looking to hire full-time employees but are struggling to find suitable talent. Consequently, they can participate in the training effort through alternative methods, such as the POE <i>(Préparation Opérationnelle à l’Emploi)</i> program in France, which is a 'train then hire' type of initiative. OpenClassrooms is actively exploring these opportunities in parallel.<br></p>
