        <p>Every year, we revisit our mission statement: Make Education Accessible. Not to change it, but to consider how to best implement it. We crafted this mission to guide us, yet annually, we must reconsider the objectives that will actualize this statement. This marks our fifth mission report, summarizing our endeavors to breathe life into the mission alongside a set of objectives defined by our mission committee.<br></p>

        <p>A new perspective on  our objectives Upon our transition to a mission-driven company in 2018, our mission committee outlined operational objectives aimed at addressing five categories of students who face specific barriers to accessing education: → unemployed individuals → individuals with low to no qualifications → residents of disadvantaged areas → refugees → individual with disabilities<br></p>
