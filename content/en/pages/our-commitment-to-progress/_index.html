        <p><b>We have begun collecting more data from our free users, particularly regarding their career outcomes. However, there's room for improvement:</b></p><p>→ We can delve deeper into understanding our free users, including their demographics, learning objectives, and employment status.</p><p>→ We should highlight our free content impact: OpenClassrooms offers all courses for free under a Creative Commons license, a unique aspect of our platform. Yet, we need to better communicate the impact of our free courses.</p><p>Enhanced insights will enable us to tailor our free content more effectively, maximizing positive outcomes for all users.<br></p>

        <p><b>However, upon graduation, our data collection gets more challenging.</b></p><p>Only 25 % of graduates share salary information, often in ranges rather than specifics. To accurately report job placement rates and salaries, we must amplify our data collection efforts. While progress has been made, completing and implementing this process for all graduates is crucial.<br></p>
