        <p><b>However, upon graduation, our data collection gets more challenging.</b></p><p>Only 25% of graduates share salary information, often in ranges rather than specifics. To accurately report job placement rates and salaries, we must amplify our data collection efforts. While progress has been made, completing and implementing this process for all graduates is crucial.<br></p>
