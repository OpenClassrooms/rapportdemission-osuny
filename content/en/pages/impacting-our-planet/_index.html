        <p>At OpenClassrooms, we’re dedicated to creating a service with the lowest impact possible on the planet. Any economic activity will use a number of ressources. However, in our reach for making education accessible for the highest number, we strive to improve the efficiency of our operations to maximize our impact while minimizing resource consumption.<br></p>

        <p>Unlike industries with heavy reliance on physical infrastructure or transportation fleets, our activities primarily involve digital operations and services. This means our environmental impact primarily stems from our carbon footprint. Despite the absence of physical production processes, our digital operations still contribute to carbon emissions through energy consumption associated with data centers, server usage, and internet infrastructure. <br></p>
