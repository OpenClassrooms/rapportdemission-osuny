        <p>The OpenClassrooms mission is two-fold: Make Education Accessible means equipping individuals with up-to-date competencies and skills, but also fostering career progress and opening new professional perspectives to people from all backgrounds - especially to those who, for one reason or another, may encounter difficulties when looking for a job. <br></p>

        <p>While the apprenticeship model itself is effective in creating learning and career advancement opportunities, access to apprenticeships remains challenging for both employers and prospective apprentices. In some countries or regions, apprenticeships may not exist at all, or may be limited to blue-collar jobs. In other regions where the model is prevalent, administrative obstacles still complicate access.</p><p>In France, 44 % of apprentices have encountered difficulties in finding a suitable position, while 34 % of surveyed employers have opted to stop recruiting apprentices due to sourcing or administrative challenges. </p><p>To facilitate access to the apprenticeship talent pool for employers, OpenClassrooms has developed a seamless recruitment process by creating a thoroughly automatized, 100 % online talent marketplace. Employers looking for apprentices now have direct access to an online platform with a large pool of candidates. Similarly, candidates have the ability to apply with just a few clicks, streamlining the entire process. <br></p>
