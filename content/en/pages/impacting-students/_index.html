        <p>Having a positive impact on our students' lives goes beyond providing access to education. It's about empowering them to transform their lives by equipping them with skills that enhance their employability. Furthermore, when assessing our impact on students, we must consider their backgrounds and the obstacles they face. Our ability to assist them in overcoming these barriers can significantly influence their outcomes. In essence, the greater the obstacle, the greater our impact.<br></p>

        <p>The barriers to education our students face encompass various factors, including limited access to prior education, financial constraints, geographical or social limitations, as well as stereotypes and biases in decision-making processes. Additionally, learning or physical disabilities may further impede their educational journey.<br></p>

        <p>NB: the job placement rate indicates placement within 6 months of graduation. Because many students from last year have graduated less than 6 months ago at the time of this report, we expect the job placement rate to continue to rise until we have the final rate for 2023.<br></p>

        <p>Looking at the decrease in orientation rate, it may seem that our applicants struggled more to become students. However, it’s essential to consider that data in context: our applicant number actually increased by +190 % last year. This surge can be attributed to a combination of successful marketing campaigns and enhancements to our platform.</p><p>We basically opened up the doors for more people to apply, but fully-financed training seats did not grow at the same rate during this period. Consequently, a significant number of students opted to fully fund their training themselves. However, this solution isn't feasible for everyone, leading to a mechanical decrease in our orientation rate.<br></p>

        <p>This scenario raises additional questions for the years ahead: while it's crucial to ensure that prospective students are well-prepared to graduate at the end of their program, implementing too many prerequisites and screening procedures could potentially contradict our mission to make education accessible. Thus, finding the right balance between orientation rate and graduation rate will be one of OpenClassrooms’ main challenges in the near future.<br></p>

            During my career transition, juggling with my family life, which includes three young children and a spouse, along with my training schedule, has been a challenge that I have overcome with dedication. In spite of my obligations, I am fully committed to my training. These challenges only strengthen my determination and my ability to simultaneously manage multiple aspects of my life.<br>After signing a fixed-term contract as an IT technician at the company where I completed my internship, I plan to start an apprenticeship in September 2024 to obtain a level of education equivalent to a master's degree in systems and security management. This opens up new professional perspectives for me.

            After transitioning from a spa esthetician and masseuse to unemployment, then to a web designer, and later a front-end developer, I am now moving towards being a full-stack developer. Since September 2023, I have been apprenticing at Société Générale, where I am working on an internal application for the compliance and control department. My tutor, who is sensitive to inclusion, has assisted me in collaborating with the disability mission for accommodations related to my autism, enhancing integration and comfort within my team. This experience has been crucial for my well-being and professional advancement.
