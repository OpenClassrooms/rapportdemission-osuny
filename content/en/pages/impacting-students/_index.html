        <p>Having a positive impact on our students' lives goes beyond providing access to education. It's about empowering them to transform their lives by equipping them with skills that enhance their employability. Furthermore, when assessing our impact on students, we must consider their backgrounds and the obstacles they face. Our ability to assist them in overcoming these barriers can significantly influence their outcomes. In essence, the greater the obstacle, the greater our impact.<br></p>
