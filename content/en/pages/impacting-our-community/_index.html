        <p>Education is often regarded as a crucial investment that generates significant value for the broader community. However, it's important to recognize that education comes with costs. On average, OECD countries spend 6.2 % of their GDP on education.  Moreover, there is an increasing emphasis on transparency and efficiency in evaluating public policies, which has led to a cost-benefit evaluation approach being applied to various sectors, including those traditionally viewed as essential components of the budget like education. </p><p>For the first time this year, we have begun measuring our impact on the community with one key question in mind: what is the return on investment on education?<br></p>

        <p><b>In order to build an initial version of our impact formula comparing costs and benefits for the community, we chose to focus on two student populations in France, both funded through tax mechanisms:</b></p><p><b>→ Unemployed students </b><br> people who started their training while unemployed. Their training was financed by unemployment agencies (such as France Travail in France) and regions, with funding derived from national and regional budgets.</p><p><b>→ Apprenticeship students</b><br> individuals who choose to simultaneously learn and work. Their training was financed through apprenticeship mechanisms, such as the taxe d’apprentissage in France, which is paid by companies.<br></p>

        <p>We recognize that the results of our formula are inherently flawed due to the absence of a control group for comparison. Additionally, we acknowledge that we only capture a portion of the information required for a comprehensive cost analysis. However, we believe that constructing and testing this formula with various populations and locations will have a positive impact on helping us improve the service we provide to our students and partners.<br></p>
