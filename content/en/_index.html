        <p>“The purpose of business is to produce profitable solutions to the problems of people and planet, not profiting from producing problems,” said Colin Mayer in his book Prosperity: Better Business Makes the Greater Good’.<br><br>That’s what a mission-driven business (entreprise à mission in French) is all about and this is the reason why I was delighted to accept Pierre Dubuc and Mathieu Nebra’s invitation to become the new OpenClassrooms Mission Committee President back in June 2023.<br><br>In this role, I’m eager to bring my 40 years of experience in the software, cloud, and AI industry, as EVP and President at Microsoft Corp. and also as a founder and President of Live for Good, an NGO empowering young impact and mission-led entrepreneurs in France.<br><br>I’m excited to lead a diverse Mission Committee that represents OpenClassrooms’ stakeholders across its employees, students, mentors, shareholders, and customers. Recently, I had the pleasure to appoint two great new members: from the corporate world, Anne Lebel, Group CHRO at Capgemini and from the Public Sector, Patrice Guezou, Skills Strategy Director at Semaphores. It’s wonderful to have them on board.  <br> <br>Working together and in a close partnership with the OpenClassrooms executive team and board, we’re committed to make education accessible, including by scaling online apprenticeships in France and expanding the model in the US and the UK.<br>The report you’re about to read is the result of hard and meaningful work from the entire OpenClassrooms team and our Mission Committee. <br><br>Their daily dedication to their students’ - who come from all walks of life - success, from diploma to employment, is a testament to the amazing purpose of this very special company.<br></p>
