        <p><b>Mission and profit.<br>Profit and mission.</b></p><p>We shouldn’t have to choose. </p><p>Seeking profit without a clear attention to the social and environmental impact is eventually dangerous for the community and the planet. On the other hand, seeking only impact without a clear and profitable business model is also shortsighted and unsustainable. </p><p>When Pierre and Mathieu invited me to join OpenClassrooms as their new mission committee President, I knew it would be a unique opportunity to help drive a company that is committed to doing both: mission and profit. </p><p>In this new role, I hope to bring my 40 years of business experience at Microsoft as VP Sales, but also my impact experience as founder of the Live for Good not for profit initiative for young mission-driven entrepreneurs. </p><p>One of my first initiatives has been to make sure all voices are heard within the committee. This has led to recruiting Anne Lebel, as Employers representative, and Patrice Guzeou, as Public sector representative. They will be central to make sure the company is pursuing its mission to Make Education Accessible, notably by: </p><p>- Scaling online apprenticeships in France <br>- Expanding them overseas, in the US and the UK </p><p>The report you’ll read is the result of hard work, not just from the mission committee, but of all of the OpenClassrooms team. I have seen incredible dedication and attention to detail from a very special company that has already succeeded in showing both can be done: mission and profit, at scale.<br></p>
