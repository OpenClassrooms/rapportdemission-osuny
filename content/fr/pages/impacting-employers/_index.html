        <p>While the apprenticeship model itself is effective in creating learning and career advancement opportunities, access to apprenticeships remains challenging for both employers and prospective apprentices. In some countries or regions, apprenticeships may not exist at all, or may be limited to blue-collar jobs. In other regions where the model is prevalent, administrative obstacles still complicate access.</p><p>In France, 44 % of apprentices have encountered difficulties in finding a suitable position, while 34 % of surveyed employers have opted to stop recruiting apprentices due to sourcing or administrative challenges. </p><p>To facilitate access to the apprenticeship talent pool for employers, OpenClassrooms has developed a seamless recruitment process by creating a thoroughly automatized, 100 % online talent marketplace. Employers looking for apprentices now have direct access to an online platform with a large pool of candidates. Similarly, candidates have the ability to apply with just a few clicks, streamlining the entire process. <br></p>

        <p>In that perspective, OpenClassrooms advocates for a shift towards skills-based hiring, rather than relying solely on credentials and diplomas in recruitment practices. According to a large survey conducted by Generations among 1,325 employers in Europe, the United States and South America, employers who opted to recruit based on skills rather than diplomas experienced a 58 % increase in the number of applications. Additionally, 84 % of employers reported no difference between individuals recruited based on skills and those recruited based on diplomas.</p><p>One of the key pillars of the OpenClassrooms mission is to provide access to education and employment to a more diverse and enriched pool of individuals. As a result, thanks to OpenClassrooms, employers gain access to competencies and experiences that were previously difficult to source and hire. <br></p>

            Apprenticeship seemed like a good alternative to other types of training. The objective was to hire new talent for the long term within our company. OpenClassrooms saves employers time by pre-selecting profiles. Ilan's portfolio was very well done, and he already had a foundation in development, which allowed him to integrate quickly.

            Originally, I was looking for a career path that I could place my roots in and expand on. Once I came across OpenClassrooms, I was able to find a career path that I felt suited me, and had a support system as well to help me grow through it. Now that I’m on this path, I’m open to new opportunities thanks to the new skills set I’ve acquired by being in this beautiful program with the amazing people who have shared their knowledge with me.
